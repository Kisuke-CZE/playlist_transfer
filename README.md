# playlist_transfer
## About
Ruby script to transfer music defined by playlist from music library to another directory (typically mounted flashdrive) including directory structure from library.

By default, script converts all FLAC files from playlist to MP3 format

This is script I created to put files from my Banshee managed music library (mostly FLAC files, some MP3 files) to flashdrive
Flashdrive is used in my car radio, which reads only MP3 files and cannot read files with special characters in name.

It reads playlist file (m3u8) generated by some media player and transfers each song to destination directory, including directory structure.

## Installation
###Easy way:

<pre>sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kisuke-CZE/playlist_transfer/master/install.sh)"</pre>
