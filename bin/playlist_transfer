# (flashdrive is used in my car radio, which reads only MP3 files and cannot read files with special characters in name)
# It reads M3U8 playlist (defined by if=PATH_TO_PLAYLIST) and transfers files to output directory (defined by out=PATH_TO_DIRECTORY) including directory structure (Directory structure is created as relative from basedir=MUSIC_DIR)
# If there is any FLAC file it converts it to MP3 file
# Any other files will be just copied
# It also removes any special characters from output file path
